# Foodordering
Catering is a website that allows counter developers to promote and sell their catering.
Rural towns would be able to sell their commodities to the rest of the globe as a result of
this.
The goal of this project is to establish a portal that will allow users to buy catering from the
admin and change product information securely using a mobile device. Catering is given
priority in order to allow them to develop their skills and promote our traditional Indian
culture.

The demo of the project is shown below:
